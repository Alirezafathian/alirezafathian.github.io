<b>Classification of Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal patients based on the rs-fMRI data</b><br>
<br><br>
In this study, we are exploring the changes in the functional brain connectivity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI). This research project has two main goals: (1) To analyze the relationship between the trend of deterioration in AD progression and the changes in the functional network topology related to the AD continuum. (2) To use the results from the complex network analysis to classify patients with these disorders and develop a reliable method for early diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on fMRI data.
<br><br>
<b>Data</b><br>
The rs-fMRI and T1w images of 96 subjects (24 subjects for each group of AD, EMCI, LMCI, and CN ) from <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/" target="_blank">ADNI database</a> are analyzing in this study.<br>
<br>
<b>Methods</b><br>
We are developing a general tool to perform network analysis and also classification on any given dataset of rs-fMRI and T1w images. The general pipeline of this study is shown in the figure below.

<b>Results</b><br>
Some of the results that we have obtained so far are presented in the paper "The trend of disruption in the functional brain network topology of Alzheimer's disease." <a href= "https://alirezafathian.github.io/publications/scientific-reports-2021" target="_blank">[Link]</a>

The functional brain network of AD continuum is shown below.
