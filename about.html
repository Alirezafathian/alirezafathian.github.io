I am a master's student in mathematical biology at Tarbiat Modares University, where I study complex systems and computational neuroscience with <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AqOdi_wAAAAJ">Prof. Yousef Jamali</a>.
<br><br>
I am interested in network neuroscience, complex systems, dynamical systems, connectomics, fMRI data analysis, mathematical modeling, and machine learning.
<br><br>
My thesis investigates the changes in the functional brain connectivity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from a complex network perspective. Further, we are developing a machine learning model that enables us to classify patients with AD, patients with MCI, and cognitively normal patients. Our goal is to develop a reliable method for diagnosing AD using fMRI data.
<br><br>
My current research focuses on comparing different strategies for constructing functional brain networks from fMRI data. We hope that the results help us in future studies to choose appropriate strategies depending on the study purpose and the topological, spatial, and temporal scales on which the analysis is performed. I am also conducting a comparative assessment between the brain's functional correlation and anti-correlation networks.
